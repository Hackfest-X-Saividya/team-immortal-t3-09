## 🌍 Overview

Climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions have made environmental sustainability an important responsibility for individuals and organizations.

However, understanding one's carbon footprint is not always straightforward.

Electricity consumption, transportation activities, waste generation, and institutional operations all contribute to carbon emissions. These activities are often tracked separately, making it difficult to understand their combined environmental impact.

**CarbonIQ brings these activities together into a unified sustainability intelligence platform.**

It combines:

* Deterministic carbon emission calculations.
* Historical activity and emission analysis.
* Machine learning-based emission modelling.
* LLM-powered sustainability insights.
* What-if savings simulations.
* Sustainability reports and visualizations.

Our goal is to make carbon footprint management more understandable, accessible, and actionable.

## 🧠 AI, ML and LLM Integration

One of the important architectural decisions in CarbonIQ is separating numerical calculations from language-model interpretation.

Instead of asking an LLM to calculate the entire carbon footprint, CarbonIQ uses different components for different responsibilities.

### 1. Deterministic Calculation Engine

The calculation engine is responsible for numerical emission calculations.

It uses:

* Activity data.
* Applicable emission factors.
* Calculation rules.

Conceptually:

```text
Estimated Emissions = Activity Amount × Emission Factor
```

The exact formula depends on the activity category and the units of the emission factor.

The calculation engine provides the numerical results used by the rest of the application.

### 2. Machine Learning Model

CarbonIQ includes a serialized model artifact:

```text
carboniq_emissions_model.joblib
```

The model is intended to support data-driven emission analysis.

Model inference must use the same feature definitions, preprocessing, and units used during training.

Predictions should only be presented as forecasts when the model has actually been trained and evaluated for a forecasting task.

### 3. Large Language Model Integration

CarbonIQ integrates Groq for LLM inference, using Qwen through the configured Groq model endpoint.

The LLM is intended to:

* Explain calculated results.
* Interpret available historical information.
* Identify relevant patterns.
* Suggest possible sustainability improvements.
* Answer user questions using available context.

### Why Separate Calculation, ML and LLM?

| Component          | Primary Responsibility                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Calculation Engine | Numerical emission calculations.                                 |
| Machine Learning   | Model-based analysis and predictions.                            |
| LLM                | Explanations, recommendations, and natural-language interaction. |

This separation helps prevent language-model-generated numbers from being treated as authoritative emission calculations.

---

## 📐 Carbon Emission Calculation

CarbonIQ uses activity-based calculations to estimate environmental impact.

The general calculation is:

```text
Carbon Emissions (kg CO₂e)
          =
Activity Data × Emission Factor
```

For example, electricity-related emissions can be calculated using:

```text
Electricity Emissions =
Electricity Consumption (kWh)
×
Electricity Emission Factor (kg CO₂e/kWh)
```

Transportation and waste calculations require their respective activity units and emission factors.

### Important Considerations

* Emission factors must have documented sources.
* Activity units must be consistent with the emission factors.
* Different transportation modes require appropriate factors.
* Waste treatment and disposal methods can affect emission calculations.
* Results should be described as estimates unless supported by a verified measurement and methodology.

CarbonIQ aims to keep calculation logic separate from AI-generated explanations.

---

## 🗄️ Data Management

MongoDB Atlas is used for persistent application data storage.

The application is designed to organize information around users and their respective workspaces.

### Data Categories
